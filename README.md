# ClearTab
AND1 - Semester Project

Clear Tab is a solution to give mobile users more control over there attention and intentions while using mobile devices. While many mobile apps are fighting to keep users'
attention glued to the screen, ClearTab aims to give users a push to look up and notice the world around them before then refocus their attention. The aim of refocusing 
the users' attention is to clarify the users' actions while using mobile devices. This will attempt to bypass users getting lost in infinite scrolling in apps and give
them more control over their mobile devices use.
